The NFL has seen a shift in behaviors regarding 4th downs. What was once a predictable play (Field Goals or Punts) became a medium for teams to exhibit their aggressiveness, 
attempting to convert the 4th down for a new set of downs and more opportunities to advance to a touchdown. This project sets out to use a Bayesian hierarchical model to 
see which teams were the most aggressive on 4th downs during the 2023 NFL season, and the factors in which coaches' experience played a factor into these decisions.
